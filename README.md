# Game-Catalog-Apollo-Server

Game-Gatalog is a [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)-compliant API that wraps
RESTful [IGDB-API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#about)

## Getting Setup

To get yourself set up with all the project's dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Serge0n/Game-Gatalog-Apollo-Server.git
```

```sh
cd Game-Gatalog-Apollo-Server
```

```sh
yarn
```

### Development

With your dependencies set up, you can run Game-Gatalog-Apollo-Server by running:

```sh
yarn start
```

Which will start the server on http://localhost:4000

### Apollo Sandbox

The landing page http://localhost:4000 provides a link to Apollo Sandbox, a powerful web IDE that enables you to build and run
operations against your server. Sandbox is a special instance of the Apollo Studio Explorer that doesn't require an Apollo account.
Just push `Query your server`!
